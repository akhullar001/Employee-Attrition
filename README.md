Project to build a model capable of predicting whether or not an employee will remain working at a company or leave.

Please refer to the file `Employee-Attrition.ipynb` for the code and visualization that goes along with these projects. The csv files can be found in the `Data` directory.

To run a metaflow pipeline of the chosen model, return

```{bash}
python flow.py show #to see the DAG of the pipeline
python flow.py run #to run the code
```
